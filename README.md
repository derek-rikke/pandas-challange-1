# Project Name: Sales Data Analysis

## Overview
This project involves exploring and transforming sales data using Python and Pandas. The code is divided into four main parts:

### Part 1: Explore the Data
In this section, the code imports a dataset using Pandas, displays the first few rows, explores column names, and performs basic statistical analysis. It answers questions about the dataset, such as identifying the top three item categories and clients with the most entries.

### Part 2: Transform the Data
This section focuses on transforming the data to prepare it for analysis. It involves creating new columns, such as line_subtotal, shipping_price, line_price, line_cost, and line_profit. These columns are calculated based on existing columns like unit_price, qty, and unit_cost.

### Part 3: Confirm Your Work
The code validates the calculations by comparing the total prices for specific orders with known values from email receipts. This ensures the accuracy of the data transformations.

### Part 4: Summarize and Analyze
The final part analyzes the transformed data to find information about the top 5 clients. It calculates the total spending for each client, creates a summary DataFrame, and ranks the clients based on total profit. The results are presented in a clear and formatted manner, making it easy to understand the key insights from the data.

## How to Use
1. Ensure you have Python and Pandas installed.
2. Download the 'client_dataset.csv' file and place it in the 'Resources' folder.
3. Run the code in a Python environment, step by step, to explore, transform, confirm, and analyze the data.
4. Review the output, especially the summary DataFrame, to gain insights into client spending and profitability.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- Pandas

## Conclusion
The analysis reveals that a particular client (Client ID: 24741) is a significant contributor to the business, driving most of the sales. Further analysis and business strategies may be explored based on these findings.
